**Comment:** Proposal: Incorporate Principal Federal Economic Indicators (PFEIs) and key private series calendars to improve macro coverage. Please add the links below (prefer RSS/Atom feeds). If any are redundant or low-signal, feel free to prune in cleanup.

Direct RSS/Atom feeds for ingestion (working endpoints)

Notes
- Non-RSS schedule pages are included for context; ingestion requires RSS/Atom to pull items. OK to vet/prune.

**Reply:** Thank you—this is an excellent, actionable list and aligns perfectly with our goal to anchor macro coverage on PFEIs and a few high-signal private series.

Plan
- Immediate ingestion: We’ll onboard the working RSS/Atom feeds you provided:
  - Federal Reserve (all + monetary)
  - Treasury press releases
  - BEA
  - Conference Board (economy)
  - MBA Weekly Applications Survey
  - EIA Today in Energy
- Tagging: We’ll map incoming items to core PFEIs (e.g., CPI, payrolls, retail sales, PCE, GDP, housing, durable goods, trade) and major private series (ISM, Conference Board CC, Michigan sentiment, ADP, MBA, NAR) to power previews and fast follow-ups.
- Calendars vs. feeds: The official schedule pages (BLS, BEA, Census, FOMC, MTS/TIC, EIA schedules) will be referenced for timing/verification but not ingested unless an official feed exists. We’ll surface them in a “resources” section for readers until feeds are available.
- Aggregators: FRED and the NY Fed calendars will be used as cross-checks/backstops, not primary ingestion.
- Redundancy/noise control:
  - Fed: Keep both “press_monetary” and “press_all,” dedupe by link/ID, and prefer the monetary feed when overlapping.
  - Treasury press releases can be noisy; we’ll start broad with keyword filtering (MTS/TIC) and prune if signal-to-noise suffers.
  - EIA Today in Energy is contextual; we’ll watch for official RSS endpoints for WPSR/NG storage releases and swap in if/when available.
- What’s pending: If BLS/Census/ISM/ADP/NAR/Michigan provide official RSS endpoints suitable for releases, we’ll add them; otherwise they’ll remain as context-only links for now.

Timeline
- Feeds above will be live for the next issue’s preview/week-of coverage. We’ll do a cleanup pass after a few cycles to prune anything redundant or low-signal.

If there are any additional must-have feeds (e.g., official endpoints for ISM or ADP) that we’ve missed, please send them along. Thanks again for the thoughtful curation—this will materially improve coverage.

**Comment:** Refining the calendar addition — please add ONLY working RSS/Atom endpoints so they ingest cleanly.

BLS (Labor) — news‑release feeds
- https://www.bls.gov/feed/empsit.rss
- https://www.bls.gov/feed/cpi.rss
- https://www.bls.gov/feed/ppi.rss
- https://www.bls.gov/feed/eci.rss
- https://www.bls.gov/feed/jolts.rss
- https://www.bls.gov/feed/prod2.rss
- https://www.bls.gov/feed/realer.rss

BEA (Commerce) — news releases

Census — economic indicators
- https://www.census.gov/economic-indicators/indicator.xml

Federal Reserve — stats + policy
- https://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/press_all.xml

EIA (Energy)

Conference Board (Economy)
- https://www.conference-board.org/rss/economy/economy_all.xml

Notes
- I’ve intentionally omitted pages without RSS; those won’t ingest. If any BLS feeds return 403 on HEAD, a standard GET with a browser UA works (ingest uses a Mozilla UA already).

**Reply:** Thank you—this is exactly what we needed. We’ll switch to “RSS/Atom only” for ingestion and drop non‑feed pages from the ingest set (they’ll remain in the resources section only).

What we’re adding now (beyond what’s already live)
- BLS news-release feeds: empsit, cpi, ppi, eci, jolts, prod2, realer
- Census economic indicators: indicator.xml
- Federal Reserve statistical releases: g17, g19, h8, h15, z1

Already live and staying
- Fed: press_all, press_monetary
- BEA: rss.xml
- EIA: Today in Energy RSS
- Conference Board: economy_all.xml

Implementation details
- UA/requests: We’ll use GET with a browser UA for BLS (no HEAD) to avoid 403s.
- Dedupe and mapping: We’ll dedupe by GUID/URL and tag items to PFEIs and named series (e.g., CPI, Payrolls, PPI, ECI, JOLTS, Productivity/Unit Labor Costs, Real Earnings, Retail Sales via Census feed, Industrial Production G.17, Consumer Credit G.19, H.8 bank credit, H.15 rates, Z.1 FA).
- Noise control: Census feed will be ingested but filtered/tagged to highlight principal indicators in the newsletter/alerts. Fed statistical series will be included with sensible alert throttles (e.g., weekly H.8 lower priority than CPI/payrolls).
- Timing: We’ll increase polling around common release windows (8:30a, 10:00a, 2:00p ET) and run standard intervals otherwise.

Rollout
- We’ll deploy these feeds immediately and monitor for a cycle; any low‑signal items will be pruned in the cleanup pass.

If there are any other official Fed data feeds you’d like included (e.g., H.6) or if you prefer different alert weights for H.8/H.15, let us know. Thanks again for the precise, working endpoints.
