## Analysis

None of the listed news items clearly resolves any of the ten forecasts. Most predictions are tied to specific official acts or published announcements (appropriations enactment, EC DSA proceedings, credit outlook changes, military confirmations, WHO appeals), and today’s headlines do not provide the required documentary/official confirmation.

Market coverage does indicate heightened volatility and sharp moves in individual tech names, but the S&P 500 threshold event in the forecast requires a specific index close-to-close decline of at least 4.0%, which is not stated in the bullets. Geopolitical items (Xi–Trump call; U.S.–Iran talks) are directionally relevant to the China/USCENTCOM forecasts but fall short of the explicit resolution criteria (personnel removal announcement; confirmed kinetic engagement).
