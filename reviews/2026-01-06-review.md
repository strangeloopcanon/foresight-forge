## Analysis

For the non-Venezuela items (EU DSA action against X tied to Grok deepfake/CSAM, BOEM bonding guidance, NHTSA robotaxi ODI, PBM formulary coverage, Red Sea transit resumption, and Arctic sea-ice minimum ranking), today’s headlines offer no direct evidence either way. Overall, nothing can be conclusively scored correct/incorrect from this snapshot; the main update is that the Venezuela-related scenario has advanced sharply, which may warrant revisiting base rates and conditional likelihoods for the Venezuela-specific forecasts going forward.
