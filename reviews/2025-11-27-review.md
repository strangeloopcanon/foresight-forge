## Analysis

None of the monitored indicators have a definitive, sourced outcome in today’s news flow. The only potentially relevant hint is the CNBC note that Tokyo inflation ran hotter than expected, but without a cited figure for the November Tokyo Core CPI (ex-fresh food), we cannot determine whether it falls within the forecast range. All other items either have release dates ahead or are not discussed in the provided articles.

Focus for the next cycle should be on near-term data drops: Tokyo CPI confirmation, EA20 unemployment, and Canada’s September GDP, all of which are due around November 29, followed by China’s NBS PMIs on November 30. Market-related year-end targets (NDX ATH, Brent ≥ $86, ERCOT December peaks) and policy/security events (Android CVEs, OFAC designations) remain open with no new corroborating evidence today.
