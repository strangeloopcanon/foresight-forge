## Analysis

Today’s news is dominated by U.S. political/military developments (Iran posture, Russia/Ukraine-related headlines), trade/tariff dynamics, and several large-cap tech market moves (notably Microsoft’s sharp selloff and Apple earnings). None of the bullets provide the specific quantitative triggers needed to resolve the market/commodities forecasts (S&P 500 ≥7,200 close; Brent ≥$95 settle) or the company disclosure-based forecasts (Azure constant-currency growth in a specific future quarter; Amazon additional layoffs; Tesla-xAI investment; Micron explicitly labeled HBM revenue milestone).

The one item that is directionally relevant to a listed forecast is the Venezuela oil-sector overhaul, which could affect production capacity/investment incentives, but the prediction is explicitly tied to OPEC’s Monthly Oil Market Report (secondary sources) showing ≥1.10 mb/d for at least one month. Without that OPEC MOMR datapoint, the proper status remains pending. Overall, today’s updates change the narrative context for some forecasts (energy geopolitics, tech-cycle volatility) but do not constitute clear evidence to mark any prediction correct or incorrect.
