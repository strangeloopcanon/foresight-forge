## Analysis

Today's news flow centers on geopolitics (Syria, Israel-Gaza, Ukraine), U.S. political/legal developments, and various market commentary pieces. None of the items directly resolve the tracked forecasts, which hinge on specific regulatory filings, energy market prints, official data releases, or vendor security disclosures.

While some stories could be second-order signals—for example, shifting Fed chair odds may affect market volatility and rate expectations relevant to SPX drawdowns and mortgage rates—they do not provide definitive outcomes. Accordingly, all predictions remain pending until explicit evidence (official releases, settlements, filings, or agency notices) emerges.
