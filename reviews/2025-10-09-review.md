## Analysis

Today’s news flow is dominated by U.S. politics, the evolving Gaza cease-fire framework, and assorted corporate headlines (media M&A chatter, rare earths moves, and selective earnings). None of these items provides definitive datapoints for the tracked macro series (claims, HICP, Treasury yields, DXY) or for the specific corporate metrics (Microsoft Azure growth) and market prices (QQQ vs. DIA spread, natural gas, ASTS). Accordingly, all forecasts remain pending due to lack of confirmatory evidence.

Sentiment-wise, there are cross-currents: shutdown drama and geopolitical headlines can inject volatility, while some coverage notes continued equity resilience. However, without hard data or price closes in the articles provided, it’s premature to update probabilities or outcomes. Key watch items ahead include the Nobel Peace Prize announcement later today, weekly EIA and jobless claims prints, and upcoming earnings that could move tech leadership and the QQQ/DIA relative performance call.
