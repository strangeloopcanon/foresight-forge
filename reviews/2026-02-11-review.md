## Analysis

None of the listed predictions are directly resolved by today’s provided headlines; all remain pending. The news set is dominated by U.S. domestic politics/legal disputes (Epstein-file related hearings, state lawsuits over health funds), drone/airspace incidents and regulatory questions, and a small number of business/markets items (e.g., Cisco earnings, McDonald’s results, tariffs). These topics do not supply the specific documentary triggers required by the forecasts (e.g., Federal Register notices, SEC filings with stated proceeds, specific macro data releases, or formal licensing announcements).

There are, however, weak directional signals relevant to a couple of long-horizon items: the reported order for the Pentagon to buy electricity from coal sources suggests an administration posture more favorable to fossil fuels, which could be consistent with future attempts to weaken climate-related regulatory foundations (though it is not evidence of an endangerment-finding NPRM). Separately, the presence of a multi-state lawsuit (albeit on unrelated health-funding grounds) underscores an active state-led litigation environment, which could matter if EPA later moves against the endangerment finding. No bond issuance, stablecoin licensing, Strategy debt raise, retail-sales print, NY Fed delinquency statistic, China CPI figure, or FDA AI/MRI clearance is evidenced here.
