## Analysis

A federal shutdown-driven data blackout is the key development today. MarketWatch reports the BLS Employment Situation will not publish on 2025-10-03, preventing verification of multiple labor-market predictions tied to that specific release. Given the predictions explicitly refer to the print on that date, we classify them as needs-clarification until the report is published or authoritative figures are made available.

Other items remain open. There is no mention of the ISM Services Prices Index result, nor evidence that WTI has settled at or above $90. Likewise, no updates on EIA oil production, the diesel price threshold, an AMD-IFS manufacturing announcement, or the 10-year TIPS yield crossing 1.80%. We will revisit as official data or credible reports emerge.
