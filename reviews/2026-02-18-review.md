## Analysis

Most of the forecasted events have long deadlines and are not directly addressed by today’s headlines. The dominant relevant theme in today’s feed is heightened U.S.-Iran tension (and a related oil price jump), which is directionally consistent with the geopolitical predicates behind the Hormuz/shipping, OFAC, and SPR-release forecasts—but none of those specific, verifiable triggers (carrier announcement, OFAC press release, or SPR authorization) is present in the provided items.

The only prediction with a close near-term linkage to today’s news is the Palo Alto Networks price-drop call: there is explicit reporting that the stock fell after earnings, but the magnitude relative to the 2026-02-17 close is not stated, so it cannot be scored as correct or incorrect without price data. Meta appears in the news via courtroom testimony rather than financial guidance, so the capex-outlook prediction remains untested based on today’s bullets.
