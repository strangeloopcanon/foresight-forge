## Analysis

None of the listed news items clearly resolves any of the eight predictions. Most predictions have deadlines well into 2026 and require specific, verifiable events (committee hearing with a named figure; a financing announcement with a stated minimum size; a defined index-return spread; contract award totals; a specific CHIPS award; a published appellate merits opinion; a finalized UN treaty text; a FedEx acquisition with a disclosed price). Today’s coverage is largely about the Greenland-driven U.S.–Europe dispute, U.S. legal/political developments (ICE litigation, Fed governance litigation, tariff rhetoric), and assorted unrelated items.

The closest “signal” relevance is the cluster of stories around tariff threats and legal proceedings, but these do not constitute the required trigger for the tariff appellate-decision forecast, and the market-related bullet (stock futures slump) is not adequate to assess the multi-month RSP vs SPY total-return condition. Overall, today’s news may increase salience for some topics (Greenland, tariffs), but provides no definitive evidence to mark any prediction correct or incorrect at this time.
