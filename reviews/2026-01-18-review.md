## Analysis

Today’s news set is dominated by Greenland-related geopolitical tension and U.S. domestic political/legal stories (Minnesota protests, federal agencies, media litigation). This increases topical relevance for the Greenland/tariffs forecasts, but none of the bullets provide the specific confirmatory artifacts required (e.g., a Danish funding package announcement with new money totals, or an EC press release plus annex/list of countermeasures explicitly tied to Greenland tariffs).

For the remaining predictions (state-level bitcoin reserve law with appropriated funds, EPA enforcement against xAI in Memphis, Artemis II schedule slip to NET 2027+, major retailer gen-AI shopping assistants, OpenAI ≥$10B raise, ABLE guidance), there is no direct evidence in today’s bullets indicating the events have occurred. As a result, all items remain pending, with no outcomes ready to be marked correct/incorrect based on the provided sources.
