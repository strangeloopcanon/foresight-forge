However, the bullets provided do not show that the UN Security Council has held an emergency meeting specifically focused on the U.S. operation and the capture/detention of Maduro, nor that an official UN meeting record has been published. Also, the bullets do not clearly confirm Maduro\u2019s capture/detention."
