## Analysis

Today's news flow is heavy on U.S. politics, policy moves, and sector stories (tech, media, cannabis), with some market color on AI-related equity volatility. However, there are no definitive data prints or agency announcements that would resolve the tracked macroeconomic, policy, or market-threshold predictions.

Items like speculation around Fed leadership, cannabis rescheduling, and Coinbase’s potential prediction markets are noteworthy context but do not settle the January FOMC call or any economic releases for December 2025. Similarly, there are no cited readings for VIX, PMMS mortgage rates, Bitcoin, FX, Brent settlements, CISA KEV additions, Apple security advisories, or NOAA space weather events. As a result, all forecasts remain pending for now.
