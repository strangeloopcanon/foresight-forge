## Analysis

Today’s news flow is dominated by geopolitical and domestic political developments (Venezuela operations and policy plans, housing/investor restrictions, defense-sector capital-return constraints), plus a handful of tech/business items (e.g., Alphabet market-cap milestone; Google/Character.AI lawsuit settlement). None of the listed articles provides direct confirming or disconfirming evidence for the specific regulatory, litigation, hardware procurement, commercial rollout, real-estate, DRAM pricing, or energy-finance milestones in the predictions.

As a result, all items remain pending. The closest thematic adjacency is Nvidia-related coverage (a proposed billionaire tax) and general AI/business headlines, but these do not touch export-control rulemaking, xAI GPU procurement scale, or other forecasted triggers. To update any of these predictions, look for primary-source artifacts (Federal Register/BIS rule documents; FTC statements/CIDs made public; federal court dockets/complaints; Meta product press releases; TrendForce pricing reports; major broker quarterly leasing reports; DOE LPO conditional commitment announcements; CFS/SPARC schedule statements).
