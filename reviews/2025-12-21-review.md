## Analysis

None of the forecasted triggers appear to have resolved based on today’s headlines; all items remain pending with deadlines in 2026. The only clear topical overlap is Venezuela/oil enforcement (NYT Coast Guard pursuit), which is directionally consistent with increased scrutiny of Venezuela-linked shipping networks but is not, by itself, an OFAC SDN action or a Treasury advisory—so it does not satisfy either OFAC-related prediction.

Overall, today’s feed is dominated by U.S. politics, consumer/business features, and a Waymo operational incident, with little bearing on the specific “verification sources” named in the forecasts (SEC filings/press releases, OFAC designation notices, MPC designations, Reuters/Bloomberg export data, or explicit legislative/litigation events). If Venezuela enforcement escalates, the next high-signal confirmation points to watch are OFAC press releases/SDN updates and any FinCEN/OFAC advisories, rather than general reporting on interdictions.
