## Analysis

Today’s news is dominated by the impending end of the U.S. government shutdown, market rallies (notably value stocks), and company-specific tech headlines. None of the items directly confirm or negate the event-driven predictions (CISA directives, OFAC DPRK sanctions, SEC 8-K cyber disclosures, EU Huawei/ZTE legislative action), leaving them pending.

There are directional signals but nothing conclusive: a value tilt could help the IWD vs. IWF call, while DOT’s freeze on flight cuts and easing disruptions reduce the near-term odds of ≥2,500 cancellations, though severe California weather could still spur disruptions. Data-dependent items (EIA gasoline stocks) may be affected by shutdown timing, and market/volatility thresholds (MOVE, WTI) were not reported here. Overall, all forecasts remain open with no decisive evidence today.
