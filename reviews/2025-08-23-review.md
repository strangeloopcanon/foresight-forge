## Analysis

Today’s coverage is largely political and macro-oriented, with Jackson Hole/Fed attention and broader commentary on the administration’s policy direction. None of the articles provide decisive evidence that directly resolves any of the listed forecasts. In particular, there is no mention of a CBP rulemaking on de minimis, an offshore wind project pause or cancellation, or a DIA Director nomination.

Indirectly, the Fed’s signaling and discussion of potential rate cuts could influence the yield curve steepening odds and near-term equity leadership, which matters for the IYT/SPY and GOOGL/SPY calls. Some pieces suggest non-tech may benefit more from rate-cut expectations, which could challenge the GOOGL outperformance thesis, while broader market caution and sector rotation could affect transports’ relative performance. However, these are directional hints, not outcomes; all items remain pending.
