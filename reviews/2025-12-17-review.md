## Analysis

None of the forecasts can be resolved by today’s headlines; all remain pending because the required confirming events (official U.S. notices, insurer/operator policy announcements, court injunctions, corporate filings/funding confirmations, or specific macro prints/market settlements) are not reported in the provided news bullets.

The most relevant incremental signal appears in the Venezuela-related reporting: the mention of “blockade threat” dynamics and Venezuelan naval escorts indicates rising geopolitical and maritime enforcement risk around Venezuelan oil movements, which could increase the likelihood of downstream U.S. enforcement actions or private-sector risk controls. Separately, the cluster of immigration/ICE and federal-policy legal developments underscores a higher baseline for litigation and judicial intervention in enforcement-heavy policy areas, but there is still no specific evidence here of a TRO/preliminary injunction tied to the “expanded U.S. travel restrictions” described in the prediction.
