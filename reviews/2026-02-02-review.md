## Analysis

Today’s news provided clear signal only on one near-term forecast: the U.S. shutdown appears ongoing as of 2026-02-02, with knock-on effects like a delayed jobs report and political difficulty in reaching a deal. That doesn’t falsify the prediction (deadline 2026-02-04 UTC), but it meaningfully increases the risk it misses unless negotiations resolve quickly.

Most other forecasts remain unevaluated by the day’s headlines: no confirming evidence on Oracle debt issuance, CISA guidance on a Notepad++ compromise, CME margin changes, AstraZeneca listing changes, EU sanctions expansions, or WHO communications. One item partially intersects with the India tax forecast—coverage of India courting hyperscalers with tax breaks—but it lacks the specific evidentiary threshold the prediction requires (a Gazette/statutory instrument and a targeted zero-tax/tax-holiday regime for AI compute/data-center workloads), so it warrants clarification rather than a status upgrade.
