## Analysis

None of the listed news bullets provide direct, dispositive evidence that any of the nine forecasts have been met or failed. Most items are geopolitical (Europe-U.S. de-risking, Iran protests, Russia/Navalny), domestic U.S. governance/legal developments, and a mix of business/technology features that do not contain the specific quantitative triggers (retail control group %, OAS level, VIX close, 2-year yield threshold) or the required formal agency/publication artifacts (CBP bond notice, OFAC Venezuela payment-routing clarification, OpenAI sycophancy mitigation post).

A couple of bullets are thematically adjacent but still insufficient: the CNBC roundup on Chinese AI models does not, as summarized here, contain the required explicit margin-decline attribution to AI consumer subsidies by one of the named firms; and the market-volatility discussion does not report the VIX close threshold. Overall, all predictions remain pending, and resolving them will require checking the relevant primary sources/datasets on or before each forecast’s deadline (Census retail sales release, ICE BofA OAS time series, CBOE VIX closes, Treasury yield intraday data, OpenAI/OFAC/CBP official publications, and federal funding announcements).
