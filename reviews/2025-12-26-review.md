## Analysis

Most forecasts remain unresolved because today’s provided headlines do not contain direct, decision-grade evidence tied to the specific verification criteria (agency/company public confirmation, catalog addition, formal funding solicitation, etc.). Several are also inherently future-dated (deadlines in 2026), so absence of confirming news today is expected.

The only item with potential signal is the Nigeria-related headline. However, the headline alone is insufficient to score the prediction: the forecast requires a DoD/AFRICOM public announcement of an additional kinetic strike/operation in Nigeria targeting ISIS-linked militants. A political claim or a complex on-the-ground situation described by the press is not necessarily equivalent to an official DoD/AFRICOM announcement; verifying would require the underlying article (or a primary-source release) to confirm all elements.
