## Analysis

Today’s news flow centers on the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, court actions constraining shutdown-related moves, and broader political developments, alongside select corporate and macro headlines (e.g., Visa’s consumer read, UPS layoffs, Nvidia- and AI-related updates). None of these items provide the specific data releases or formal actions required to resolve the tracked forecasts.

Key economic prints tied to these predictions—core PCE, ISM Services, Eurozone flash HICP, Caixin PMI, and U.S. payrolls—are due in the coming days and have not posted yet. Market-level thresholds (DXY) and policy/corporate milestones (BIS export-control adjustments, Qualcomm hyperscaler partnership, Meta earnings) also lack definitive updates in the provided coverage. Accordingly, all items remain pending until official releases or verifiable announcements emerge.
