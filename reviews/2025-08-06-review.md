## Analysis

1. The prediction regarding the price of oil seeing a moderate decrease in the next month seems to be supported by the news of Trump raising India tariffs to 50% over Russian oil purchases. This aligns with the forecast of global supply surpassing demand. The confidence level of 75% seems to be well-founded based on the current developments in the oil market.

2. The prediction about tech stocks experiencing a minor correction in the next two weeks does not have clear evidence in the news provided. While there are discussions about tariffs and trade deals impacting various industries, there is no direct mention of a correction in the tech sector. This prediction might need more monitoring and refinement in terms of timing and specific factors influencing tech stocks.

3. Overall, the prediction quality and confidence calibration appear to be solid for the oil price forecast but may need further validation for the tech stocks prediction. It is important to continuously reassess and adjust predictions based on new information and developments in the market. This highlights the importance of ongoing analysis and adaptability in forecasting.

4. One pattern that could improve future predictions is to closely monitor specific events and news related to the sectors being forecasted. Additionally, considering a broader range of factors such as political decisions, trade relationships, and global economic conditions could provide a more comprehensive view for forecasting. Regularly updating and refining predictions based on real-time data and feedback loops can enhance the accuracy and relevance of forecasts.
