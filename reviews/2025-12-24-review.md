## Analysis

None of the listed news bullets provide direct confirmation or disconfirmation for the nine forecasts. Most of the predictions have 2026 deadlines and require specific, documentable events (e.g., a filed federal lawsuit; an SEC enforcement release; an SEC filing/earnings disclosure; a CDC guideline update; a company closing announcement), none of which appear in today’s headlines.

Several bullets touch adjacent themes (U.S. energy policy and climate; Venezuela pressure; China’s materials dominance), but they do not meet the forecasts’ precise triggers—particularly where the prediction requires explicit public statements, formal regulatory actions, or named parties. As a result, all items remain pending; the appropriate next check would be targeted searches of SEC/CDC/DOE primary sources and major wire services for the specified event types.
