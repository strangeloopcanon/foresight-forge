## Analysis

None of today’s listed headlines provide decisive evidence that any of the nine forecasted events occurred. Several items touch adjacent themes (AI market dynamics; Ukraine war/peace plan discussions), but they do not meet the specific, operational criteria in the predictions (e.g., a definitive acquisition agreement with a disclosed/reliably reported price; a publicly confirmed direct in-person bilateral meeting including demilitarized-zone/troop-pullback discussions; a formal OIG announcement).

Given the relatively long horizons (most deadlines in 2026), the correct stance for all items remains “pending.” The key watchpoints going forward are (1) primary-source announcements (press releases, SEC filings, court dockets, IRP/PUC filings, OIG notices) and (2) clearly attributable, reliable reporting that satisfies the predictions’ thresholds (e.g., transaction value ≥$10B; cooperation package ≥$100M; retirement delay ≥24 months with explicit federal-policy rationale).
