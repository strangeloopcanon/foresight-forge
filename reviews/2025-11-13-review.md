## Analysis

None of today’s coverage provides definitive resolution for the tracked forecasts. The Blue Origin launch and booster landing signal a healthy cadence in U.S. commercial spaceflight, but it falls outside the specified launch-count window. Market stories point to shifting rate expectations and risk sentiment, yet they lack the concrete CME FedWatch and Cboe SKEW readings required to score those items. Similarly, there are no cited figures for PPI or retail sales, and no AAA national gas price prints.

Policy and macro headlines—tariff adjustments aimed at food prices, government reopening, and broader geopolitical developments—could indirectly influence some forecasts (e.g., gasoline prices, market risk metrics). However, without specific, verifiable data releases or index closes, all items remain pending. We will watch for the mid-month economic prints and market closes, as well as official updates from CISA and OFAC, to reassess.
