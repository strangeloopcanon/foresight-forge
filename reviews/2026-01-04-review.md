## Analysis

Today’s news meaningfully increases the plausibility of several Venezuela-linked predictions (Congressional War Powers/AUMF activity, OFAC licensing changes, regional diplomatic responses, and aviation disruption) because it confirms a high-salience trigger event: Maduro’s capture and ensuing U.S. policy messaging. However, none of the listed bullets provide direct, dispositive evidence that any of the forecasted institutional actions (floor vote, OFAC general license change, multilateral communique) have occurred.

The only item that partially touches a concrete, measurable condition is the airline/airspace disruption story, but the forecast’s criterion is duration-based (14 consecutive days of restrictions/reroutes), which cannot be confirmed from a single-day snapshot. The remaining forecasts (oil export volume decline per specific trackers, CFIUS unwind orders in semiconductors, CXMT IPO filing, aggregate insider-selling headline, core goods CPI turning positive YoY, and CDC gonorrhea guidance changes) are not addressed by the provided bullets and therefore remain pending.
