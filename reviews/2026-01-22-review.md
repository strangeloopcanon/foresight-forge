## Analysis

Today’s news set is heavy on U.S. federal politics (House activity and hearings), major tech governance (TikTok’s U.S. entity/joint venture), and select business/macroeconomic items (inflation gauge, equity moves, Intel guidance). None of the provided items directly supply the specific evidentiary hooks required to resolve the forecasts (e.g., bill introduction/referral records, hearing titles from House Financial Services, market closes for VIX/natural gas, central-bank decisions, or official trade statistics).

As a result, all forecasts remain pending, not because they are unlikely, but because the day’s coverage doesn’t intersect with the measurable criteria. To update statuses, the next checkpoints should be: Congress.gov (bill text and committee referral), House Financial Services hearing schedules and published titles, official market settlement/close data (CBOE VIX close; NYMEX NG settlement), Bank of Korea MPC announcements, Japan MOF trade releases, Meta earnings materials/transcripts, FCC ECFS filings by Blue Origin, state session laws, and ClinicalTrials.gov new registrations.
