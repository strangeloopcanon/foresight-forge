## Analysis

None of today’s headlines provide definitive outcomes for the listed forecasts. The key event-driven items—namely the FOMC SEP, U.S. Industrial Production, and UK CPI—are scheduled for release in the coming days, and there are no leaks or early data cited here. Market-related articles discuss sentiment and strategy but do not include the specific price, index, or FX levels needed to resolve any claims.

Accordingly, all items remain pending. Focus in the next review cycle should be on the 2025-09-17 Fed releases (SEP and Industrial Production) and the 2025-09-18 UK CPI print, while continuing to monitor OFAC press releases, AAA fuel price updates, TTF settlement data, and any official announcements from Joby or Archer.
