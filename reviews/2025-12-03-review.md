## Analysis

None of today’s reporting definitively resolves any of the tracked forecasts. The only directly relevant market signal is that U.S. equities are described as closing near record levels, which suggests the S&P 500 all-time-high call remains plausible but not achieved yet. There is no mention of Treasury yields, copper or natural gas settlements, Cboe SKEW, or space-weather alerts.
Policy headlines focus on fuel-efficiency rollbacks, immigration operations, and geopolitical developments around Ukraine, but there is no concrete evidence of new U.S. OFAC or UK Russia-related sanctions designations today. Security-related items (Microsoft/Adobe patch expectations) hinge on upcoming December releases and are therefore still pending.
