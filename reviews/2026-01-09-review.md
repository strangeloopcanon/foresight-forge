## Analysis

The clearest resolution is the labor-market call: the reported December 2025 payroll gain (~+50k) and unemployment rate (~4.4%) miss both bounds of the forecast range, making that prediction decisively incorrect by its deadline. Most other items remain untestable from today’s bullets and therefore stay pending.

The main potential “hit” is the mortgage-bond purchase prediction: headlines state that purchases are starting and that Trump ordered buying $200B in mortgage bonds, which—if confirmed to be agency MBS—would satisfy the threshold and the senior-official endorsement condition. However, because the provided bullets don’t explicitly specify “agency MBS” (as opposed to a broader mortgage-credit program), the appropriate status is needs-clarification pending verification of the instrument and program details.
