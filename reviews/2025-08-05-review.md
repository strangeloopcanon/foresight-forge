## Analysis

1. The prediction about tech stocks experiencing a minor correction in the next two weeks seems to be playing out, as evidenced by Snap shares plummeting 15% after weak second-quarter revenue and Opendoor tanking after earnings. Additionally, AMD's stock fell despite a strong earnings outlook due to weaker-than-expected earnings. The prediction was supported by specific news events in the technology sector, indicating that the market correction may be underway as anticipated.

2. The prediction about renewable energy stocks outperforming traditional energy sectors in the next month lacks evidence in the current news context. While there were mentions of Tesla and Rivian missing earnings estimates, there was not enough information to support the overall outperformance of renewable energy stocks. This prediction may be off-track or missing key factors such as specific developments or announcements in the green energy sector that could impact stock performance.

3. Overall, the prediction quality and confidence calibration seem to be moderate. The predictions on oil prices decreasing, tech stocks experiencing a correction, and the overall market exhibiting volatility were supported by specific news events. However, the predictions on renewable energy stocks and the housing market facing challenges lacked clear evidence in the news. Moving forward, it may be beneficial to incorporate more detailed analysis of industry-specific developments and market trends to enhance the accuracy of forecasts and increase confidence levels.

4. To improve future predictions, it could be helpful to monitor sector-specific news closely to identify key developments that may impact stock performance. Additionally, considering a broader range of factors such as geopolitical events, regulatory changes, and economic indicators could enhance the depth and accuracy of forecasts. Incorporating more quantitative analysis, historical data, and expert insights could also strengthen the predictive model and improve confidence calibration in forecasting outcomes.
