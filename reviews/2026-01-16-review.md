## Analysis

None of the listed predictions are clearly resolved by today’s headlines; all remain pending with deadlines ranging through 2026. The only partial thematic touches are Greenland-related geopolitical reporting (U.S. lawmakers meeting Denmark’s prime minister; a separate item about Trump floating tariffs connected to Greenland), but these do not satisfy the specific exercise/tariff evidentiary requirements embedded in the forecasts.

The day’s coverage leans heavily toward U.S. domestic politics and institutions (Powell vs. Trump, pardons, immigration/ICE-related reporting) and a few business/tech items (OpenAI chip deals, ChatGPT ads, Micron). Those stories do not constitute the formal, document-based triggers required by several predictions (e.g., Federal Register/USTR/CBP guidance, FDA docket actions, FHFA consultation documents, Wikimedia budget disclosures). Continued monitoring should prioritize primary-source artifacts (official notices, dockets, budget plans, corporate earnings guidance) rather than general political rhetoric or early-stage reporting.
