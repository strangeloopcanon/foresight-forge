## Analysis

None of the listed headlines provide direct, dispositive evidence that any of the nine forecasts has been achieved or falsified. The day’s coverage is dominated by geopolitics (U.S.-Iran escalation risk; U.S. posture toward Russia; Gaza-related initiatives) and several domestic political/legal stories, none of which directly map to the specific measurable triggers in the prediction set (Fed target range cut, PMI threshold breach, Freddie Mac PMMS rate print, IAEA Board resolution, DoD contract award size/category, FDA approval, M&A closing, federal fintech penalty for a large breach, or Figma guidance revision).

There are a few thematically adjacent items—e.g., market/rate discussion and oil-price moves tied to Iran tensions, plus AI-sector developments (Nvidia reportedly discussing a major OpenAI investment)—but they are not the required confirming artifacts (official Fed action; an ISM release; a Freddie Mac PMMS datapoint; an IAEA Board vote text; a specific DoD award notice; an FDA approval letter/announcement; a merger closing announcement; a regulator press release specifying penalty size and breach scope; or a Figma guidance update). As a result, all items remain pending.
