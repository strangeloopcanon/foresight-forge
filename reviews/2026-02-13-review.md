## Analysis

None of the listed predictions are cleanly resolved by today’s headlines. Several topics are directionally relevant (notably heightened Epstein-related scrutiny and ongoing AI-sector developments), but the bullets lack the specific, outcome-defining facts required to mark any prediction correct or incorrect under the stated criteria.

The Epstein thread looks like a potential leading indicator for the “executive departure tied to Epstein-files controversy” prediction, given a reported CEO change with Epstein links; however, it does not satisfy the S&P 500 constraint as presented. Likewise, the Anthropic items signal corporate momentum (ad impact, board changes) but do not constitute the predicted major-version flagship model release with an accompanying technical/system card. Market and macro pieces are suggestive but provide no concrete threshold hits (S&P drawdown, 10-year ≤3.00%, or NAR sales ≤3.75m) to update statuses.
