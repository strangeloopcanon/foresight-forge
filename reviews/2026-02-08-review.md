## Analysis

None of today’s cited stories provide direct, decision-grade evidence that any of the eight predictions have been satisfied or falsified. The coverage is concentrated on politics (U.S. DOJ staffing, unsealed election-case documents), international elections (Japan, Portugal, Thailand), extreme weather in the U.S. Northeast, Super Bowl-related pieces, and Epstein-file developments—topics largely orthogonal to the specific regulatory/market milestones forecasted.

A few items are directionally adjacent (general AI coverage could be a precursor context for future FTC deepfake enforcement; impending jobs/inflation reporting is related to CPI monitoring; Super Bowl-related coverage touches the NFL/media ecosystem), but none contains the concrete triggers required by the prediction criteria (e.g., a specific FTC enforcement announcement, a BLS electricity-index reading, a FERC tariff filing, or an NFL rights-deal announcement). As a result, all items remain pending awaiting future, explicitly corroborating news or official releases.
