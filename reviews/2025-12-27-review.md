## Analysis

None of the listed headlines provide direct, decision-grade evidence that any of the forecasted events occurred (e.g., no official AU communique on Somaliland/Israel, no OFAC 30+ designation package, no California wealth-tax bill introduction meeting the threshold, no Target 13D, and no Oracle capex pullback disclosure). As a result, every forecast remains unresolved and is appropriately kept as pending.

Several items are thematically adjacent but not dispositive: the Ukraine/Russia coverage does not indicate a specific OFAC action; the student-loan bankruptcy trend piece is not an Education Department NPRM on IDR; and the tech/antitrust commentary does not constitute a publicly confirmed FTC/DOJ investigation into a 2026 AI-accelerator transaction (and the prediction’s 2026 trigger condition has not been met yet). Overall, today’s news flow is largely orthogonal to the specified verification criteria for these forecasts.
