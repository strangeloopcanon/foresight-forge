## Analysis

None of today’s headlines provide direct, decision-level evidence that would resolve any of the nine forecasts. The news cycle is dominated by U.S. actions in Venezuela (capture of Maduro, unsealed indictment, market implications, congressional reaction) plus a domestic Interior-related ethics story about a lithium mine—adjacent to the Department of the Interior theme but not connected to offshore-wind leasing/permitting pauses.

Given the absence of relevant signals, all items remain pending. The only thematic linkage worth monitoring is that major foreign-policy escalation and associated enforcement actions (indictments, sanctions, asset seizures) can sometimes precede sanctions-evasion forfeiture cases or OFAC packages, but today’s bullets do not describe an Iran human-rights designations tranche nor a tanker forfeiture with a named vessel. Future checks should specifically look for (a) Federal Register/BOEM directives on offshore wind, (b) OFAC press releases with designation counts and stated justification, (c) DOJ forfeiture complaints naming ships/IMOs, and (d) Tesla/Saks/MeitY/Senate bill announcements.
