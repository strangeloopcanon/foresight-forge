## Analysis

None of the listed predictions can be resolved from today’s headlines alone: there are no explicit confirmations of grid EEA declarations, FlightAware cancellation totals, USD/JPY daily range metrics, BLS CPI Energy index prints, Senate Banking stablecoin markup activity, BIS export-control rule publications, Databricks S-1 filing, BDC non-accrual disclosures, or OFAC sanctions packages meeting the specified thresholds.

However, today’s coverage of a significant winter storm and heavy snow/sleet forecasts is directionally relevant to two near-term operational-risk forecasts: grid emergencies and flight cancellations. These stories provide contextual support that stressors may be present, but without explicit operator alerts or cancellation statistics they do not substantiate an outcome.

The remaining forecasts (stablecoin markup, BIS AI-chip controls, IPO filing, BDC non-accruals, OFAC Iran oil sanctions, CPI energy spikes, USD/JPY volatility) are not addressed by the provided news set; they remain purely time-dependent until corroborating primary-source releases (committee schedules/records, Federal Register/BIS notices, SEC filings, 10-Q/10-Ks, OFAC press releases, BLS releases, or market data) appear.
