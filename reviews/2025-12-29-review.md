## Analysis

None of the listed news items provides direct, checkable evidence that any of the nine forecasts has been resolved as true or false. Most predictions are tied to specific official publications (BLS CPI releases, Federal Register NPRM), named regulators (PIPC), or explicit public announcements (DOJ/FTC settlement; U.S. assistance reduction), and today’s headlines do not contain those triggers.

The closest thematic overlap is geopolitical coverage involving Colombia/Venezuela and U.S. actions in the region, but the forecast requires a clearly stated U.S. announcement of a specific funding pause/suspension/reduction (≥$50 million) for Colombia assistance programs—details not present in the bullets. Overall, the appropriate status for all items remains pending, with no clear basis to update confidence or record an outcome from today’s news alone.
