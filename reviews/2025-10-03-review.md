## Analysis

Today’s coverage is dominated by the ongoing U.S. federal government shutdown, with multiple pieces confirming its continuation as of October 3 and noting knock-on effects like the absence of the jobs report. This substantiates the condition for the shutdown-related forecast but provides no evidence of a resolution via a continuing resolution or appropriations yet, so that call remains open. Other domestic politics headlines (immigration, court rulings) do not touch the specific policy or legal triggers in the predictions list.

Market-related items mention the S&P 500 flirting with a record close and a Bitcoin rally, but there is no quantitative detail to resolve relative ETF performance, individual stock price thresholds, gasoline futures levels, or USD/MXN levels. International and security pieces include an opinion on a U.S. “cartel war,” but there’s no sign of a formal SRE statement from Mexico. As such, all non-shutdown forecasts remain pending due to lack of decisive evidence in today’s news.
