## Analysis

None of the listed news items provide direct, decision-level evidence that would resolve any of the forecasts. The headlines cluster around U.S. politics and governance (Trump administration actions, regulatory dynamics, Munich-related diplomacy), business/media developments, and general market/AI coverage, but they do not report the specific official documents, sanction packages, regulatory rules, or clinical trial registrations required to mark outcomes as correct or incorrect.

Several forecasts remain plausibly “watchable” based on the broader backdrop (e.g., ongoing U.S.-EU geopolitical tensions and AI/export-control discourse), but today’s coverage does not contain the necessary artifacts (Federal Register rules, OFAC press releases, EU Council/Commission legal acts, Trustees Report text, ClinicalTrials.gov entries, or verified Brent settlement prints). As deadlines are months away, the appropriate status across the board is pending until a qualifying primary announcement or publication appears.
