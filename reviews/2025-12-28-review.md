## Predictions Reviewed

- U.S. DHS (ICE/HSI) will publicly announce a single-day worksite/logistics enforcement operation resulting in at least 250 arrests/detentions across one metro area, by 2026-06-30 (UTC). (Confidence: 45%)
- The USTR will publish a Federal Register notice imposing an additional tariff rate of at least 10% on a defined list of imports with an estimated annual import value of at least $50 billion (as stated by USTR/ITC or reported by Reuters/Bloomberg), effective no later than 2026-09-30 (UTC). (Confidence: 40%)
- At least one of Moody’s, S&P Global Ratings, or Fitch will downgrade (not just place on watch) a rated U.S. private student-loan ABS tranche, citing increased bankruptcy discharge risk and/or higher-than-expected losses, by 2026-12-31 (UTC). (Confidence: 35%)
- The European Commission will publish a formal legislative proposal (COM document) creating or scaling an EU-level funding program of at least €10 billion specifically for AI compute infrastructure (data centers, accelerators, or AI supercomputing) and/or associated grid/power enablement, by 2026-12-31 (UTC). (Confidence: 30%)
- LME 3-month copper will settle at or above $10,500 per metric tonne at least once, by 2026-06-30 (UTC). (Confidence: 42%)

- At least one of Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, or Meta will explicitly cite 'copper' as a supply constraint or cost driver for data-center or AI infrastructure buildouts in an earnings-call transcript, by 2026-06-30 (UTC). (Confidence: 55%)

## Analysis

None of the listed predictions can be confidently resolved from today’s provided headlines/bullets; all remain pending due to lack of direct, criterion-matching evidence (e.g., specific agency notices, ratings actions, commodity settlements, or corporate deal announcements). Several bullets touch adjacent themes—U.S. immigration politics, U.S.-Ukraine diplomacy, and Big Tech’s policy positioning—but they do not satisfy the operationally specific triggers in the forecasts.

The closest “directional” signals are sectoral: the MarketWatch quantum computing piece suggests ongoing investor attention (relevant to the equity-raise forecast), and the NYT article on tech and Trump speaks to continued momentum/enablement for AI infrastructure (tangentially relevant to compute/power buildout-related forecasts). However, neither provides the concrete event confirmations (e.g., an underwritten ≥$200M offering, a named ≥1 GW power procurement, or an earnings transcript explicitly citing copper) required to mark any prediction correct or incorrect.
