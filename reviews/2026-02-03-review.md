## Analysis

Today’s news set does not contain direct confirmatory evidence for any of the nine forecasts. Most items are unrelated (Epstein-related political/legal coverage, domestic politics, corporate earnings/markets), so the appropriate disposition is broadly 'pending' rather than updating outcomes.

The only partial intersection is the CNBC report that Senate Banking Democrats want to delay a Fed nomination until 'Powell and Cook investigations' conclude. That is suggestive of ongoing scrutiny but does not satisfy the forecast’s specific trigger (a DOJ or DOJ OIG public confirmation of a review/investigation explicitly naming Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve). Likewise, the U.S. shooting down an Iranian drone indicates escalation but is not evidence of a publicly acknowledged direct U.S.-Iran meeting. Overall, no forecast can be marked correct/incorrect based on these bullets alone.
