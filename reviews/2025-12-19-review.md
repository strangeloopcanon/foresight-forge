## Analysis

None of the listed predictions can be marked resolved based on today’s headlines; all remain pending because the relevant deadlines are in 2026 and today’s coverage does not provide definitive confirmation or disconfirmation for any item. The strongest “directional” signal is on TikTok: reporting that Oracle joined an investor group to run TikTok’s U.S. business is consistent with continued U.S. availability, but it is not a clear, final condition about app-store download status on a specific date in mid-2026.

Cannabis-related news also creates informative context but not resolution. Coverage of Trump’s move to reclassify cannabis (Schedule III) increases relevance for the IRS/280E prediction, yet the prediction is narrowly about the IRS publishing guidance explicitly stating 280E no longer applies (and with an effective tax-year-2026 framing). Without that specific IRS action, the forecast remains unscored.

Overall, today’s news is largely orthogonal to the remaining forecasts (BoJ rates, EU Ukraine financing via frozen assets proceeds, DDR5 contract prices, Nike China revenue, Fed supervision documentation, a specific merger filing, and satellite quantum comms). Future assessment will require targeted source checks (official central bank statements, EU Council/Parliament acts, TrendForce reports, Nike 10-Q/earnings release, Fed SR letters, SEC EDGAR filings, and credible scientific/agency announcements).
