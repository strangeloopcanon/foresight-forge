## Analysis

None of the listed forecasts can be decisively resolved by today’s headlines. The dominant relevant signal is the BYD/Tesla coverage, but it addresses unit sales leadership rather than the specific coordinated MSRP cuts required by that prediction, so it does not move the outcome beyond “pending.” Similarly, the market commentary does not establish the quantitative Nasdaq drawdown condition.

For the rest, today’s news stream is largely U.S. politics, business leadership changes, and assorted features, with no direct evidence on NATO Baltic infrastructure protection initiatives, Finnish prosecutorial actions on the undersea cable incident, MAS policy settings, U.S. PUC dockets on AI/data-center load, U.S. student-loan tax legislation, CMS Part D obesity-drug guidance, or large AI-cited European bank job-cut restructurings. All remain live with ample time before their respective deadlines.
