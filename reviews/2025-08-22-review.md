## Analysis

Macro signals today leaned dovish after Powell suggested conditions may warrant rate cuts, prompting a bond rally and likely exerting downward pressure on Treasury yields and the dollar. That backdrop could modestly reduce near-term odds for USD/JPY spiking through 152 and for the 10-year yield breaching 4.45%, though one day’s reaction is not dispositive and other Fed voices expressed caution.

On equities, the report of Apple considering Gemini for Siri lifted Alphabet, while tariff headlines weighed on some discretionary names—both directionally supportive for the XLP-over-XLY and GOOGL-over-MSFT calls, respectively, but still far from definitive given the multi-week horizons. There was no news confirming vendor advisories on the Dnsmasq CVE. Overall, none of today’s developments conclusively resolves any prediction; all remain pending with slightly shifted near-term risk skews.
