## Analysis

None of today’s reported stories provide direct confirmation or disconfirmation for the listed forecasts. The dominant news themes are U.S. politics/legal developments (including extensive Epstein-related coverage), select business earnings/market items (Ford, Lyft, Robinhood), and a few international policy pieces (e.g., Guatemala ending use of Cuban doctors). These do not intersect cleanly with the specific trigger conditions in the predictions (Hormuz boarding confirmations, JWC Listed Areas updates, airline route suspensions due to Cuba jet fuel, Alphabet financing/capital return actions, OpenAI ads onboarding documentation, Databricks IPO filing, state enforcement against sports-event prediction markets, LIHTC House passage, or NATO raising the defense-spending floor).

The only partial adjacency is the Robinhood/prediction-market discussion, which could be weakly related to the forecast about state-level enforcement against sports-event prediction markets; however, today’s bullet does not indicate an actual enforcement action by a named state AG/regulator, so the status remains pending. Overall, the day’s news neither advances nor materially undermines the forecasts based on the evidence provided.
