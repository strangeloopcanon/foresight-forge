## Analysis

None of the listed predictions are directly addressed by today’s news bullets, so all outcomes remain pending. The current set is dominated by U.S. politics/legal stories, health/biopharma pieces, and general business/tech coverage, without the specific regulatory filings (FERC, EU Commission), procurement awards (Canada), or quantified metrics (Bitcoin ETF net flows, JNTO arrival data) needed to resolve the forecasts.

There are a couple of weak directional signals but not decision-grade evidence. In particular, the report that major tech CEOs (including Altman) are traveling to India for an AI summit marginally increases the plausibility of future India-focused announcements, but it is not a consumer distribution bundle with a telecom/OEM that explicitly includes a paid ChatGPT tier. Likewise, general media-industry headlines do not constitute the specific SEC/press confirmation required for WBD–Paramount exclusive negotiations or an MOU.
