## Analysis

Today’s news flow is suggestive but not determinative for these forecasts. Market coverage highlights a Fed-fueled rally and rising odds of a September rate cut after a long pause, with futures relatively flat into Monday and Asia tracking gains. That supports the plausibility of the FOMC cut call and could favor small-cap risk appetite, but no outcomes are finalized. There’s also no fresh data for August payrolls yet, leaving the labor-market forecast unresolved.

Geopolitical stories (Ukraine talks centered on Donbas, U.S.–South Korea–China dynamics) and China’s property sector strain (Evergrande delisting) may bias risk sentiment and volatility, but no specific triggers pushed VIX above the threshold today. Energy prices and credit spreads weren’t highlighted in a conclusive way, and there were no SEC alerts matching the SPV/secondary-sales criterion. Overall, all items remain pending pending concrete data or official actions.
