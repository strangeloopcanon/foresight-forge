## Analysis

Today’s news flow is dominated by U.S. politics (Trump administration actions, Kennedy Center renaming), TikTok’s U.S. deal structure, and a notable corporate transaction involving Trump Media and a nuclear fusion firm. None of these provide direct, dispositive evidence to resolve most of the listed predictions, which are largely tied to regulatory actions, specific macro/market thresholds, or clearly defined corporate product launches.

The only partial “touches” are Oracle and Micron: Oracle appears in commentary about TikTok’s U.S. arrangements, and Micron is covered in a market-focused piece. However, neither bullet contains the concrete event criteria required by the predictions (Oracle’s Michigan-project financing partner announcement; Micron’s reported quarterly revenue ≥ $9.0B in an earnings release). One prediction (Coursera–Udemy) is difficult to score as written because it presupposes an announced merger; without identifying the announcement or verifying it exists, the forecast is not well-anchored for verification.
