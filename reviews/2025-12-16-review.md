## Analysis

None of the listed news bullets provide decisive evidence to resolve any of the eight forecasts. The day’s coverage is concentrated on U.S. domestic politics and crime, several Australia shooting follow-ups, and a handful of business/markets stories (Tesla, Waymo funding talks, Pfizer guidance, oil prices), but these do not intersect with the specific measurable triggers in the predictions (EU Council sanctions renewal decision, Treasury Monthly Statement customs receipts threshold, MOVE Index level, PayPal bank application disclosure, Ford storage contract size, DoD/Korea Zinc investment agreement, NDX one-day -3% move, or a Russian official acknowledgment of submarine damage).

The only thematic overlap is the Ukraine-related NYT item about security guarantees, which could be loosely adjacent to the EU sanctions forecast and the Russia/underwater-attack forecast; however, it does not report the required official actions or acknowledgments needed for verification. As a result, all items remain pending until specific primary-source announcements or relevant quantitative market/government releases are observed.
