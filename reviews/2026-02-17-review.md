## Analysis

None of the listed predictions are directly validated or falsified by today’s news set. The items span product announcements (Apple Podcasts), U.S. legislative process (Senate HELP), regulatory enforcement (FinCEN/OFAC/FTC), macro labor data (BLS), industrial M&A (container shipping), sanctions policy, and an India public-sector compute program; today’s headlines are dominated by geopolitics (U.S.-Iran talks, Ukraine), U.S. domestic politics, and tech/business earnings and partnerships.

There are a few thematic touchpoints—e.g., Iran/Strait of Hormuz and broader foreign-policy coverage could foreshadow future sanctions-related developments—but nothing in the bullets constitutes the specific, documentable actions required by the forecasts (e.g., an OFAC press release with wallet addresses; a FINCEN FIN- advisory; a committee markup/report-out; or a BLS release hitting a numeric threshold). As a result, all forecasts remain pending, with no status changes warranted based on clear evidence.
