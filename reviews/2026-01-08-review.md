## Analysis

None of the listed news items provide decisive evidence that any of the nine medium-to-long-horizon predictions have been resolved. The day’s coverage is dominated by U.S. law-enforcement incidents, Trump/politics, and broad market/macroeconomic previews (e.g., the upcoming jobs report), which are not sufficient to verify the specific, criteria-based triggers in the forecasts.

A few bullets are directionally adjacent—market commentary could relate to the Apple vs. Alphabet market-cap prediction, and defense spending headlines could loosely connect to DoD procurement policy—but neither contains the precise, confirmatory facts required (e.g., a documented 10-session market-cap lead; a formal DoD memo/DFARS action conditioning eligibility on buyback/dividend limits). For the next review cycle, the most likely to move based on routine data/news cadence are the JOLTS threshold (via BLS releases) and any congressional bill introductions; the others depend on discrete corporate/agency announcements.
