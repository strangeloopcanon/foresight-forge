## Analysis

None of the listed predictions appear to have reached a clear resolution based on today’s headlines. Most items are about U.S. domestic politics, health funding cuts, Epstein-related disclosures, and international/security developments, with no direct references to the specific regulatory actions (OFAC, CFTC, CFPB), security advisories (Microsoft Secure Boot), or sanctions actions (State Department on Hong Kong/PRC) that would trigger an unambiguous “correct/incorrect” determination.

The most adjacent signal is the MarketWatch item describing substantial sports-related prediction-market volume around the Super Bowl, which increases salience and potential regulatory scrutiny, but it is not itself a CFTC “formal public action” as defined in the prediction. Similarly, the Nikkei rally coverage suggests momentum but does not document the specific 45,000 close threshold. Overall, today’s news provides context that could affect future probabilities (especially around sports prediction markets and broader geopolitical/regulatory attention) but does not supply the decisive evidence required to update outcomes.
