## Analysis

Todayâ€™s news flow is dominated by U.S. political developments around Federal Reserve governance and trade/tariff policy signaling, plus assorted corporate headlines. None of the items provide definitive market closes or official data releases needed to resolve the tracked forecasts, so all remain pending.

That said, the attempted Fed shake-up and rhetoric about pushing rates lower could pressure real yields and potentially the dollar, while heightened policy uncertainty can widen credit spreads. Tariff narratives and geopolitical tensions may support a stronger USD on risk aversion but could also weigh on growth-sensitive assets. These crosscurrents raise volatility odds into September, which could impact the IBKR/SPY and WBA/SPY relative performance calls, as well as DXY, TIPS real yields, and credit spreads; confirmation will depend on forthcoming market data and scheduled economic releases.
