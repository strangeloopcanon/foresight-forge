## Analysis

Today’s news flow is dominated by AI-driven equity volatility, retail bifurcation, and select international macro signals (Japan’s exports and inflation), none of which conclusively resolve any of the tracked forecasts. Key economic prints relevant to these predictions—U.S. Core CPI (Nov), University of Michigan sentiment (Dec prelim), yield curve closes, VVIX levels, and Brent settlements—are not specified in the articles.

Political and geopolitical coverage (U.S. policy moves, Ukraine talks, immigration rulings) also lacks concrete indicators for the OFAC sanctions forecast, and there is no reporting on ERCOT wind generation or U.S. orbital launch cadence. Overall, all items remain pending with no clear, verifiable outcomes in today’s reporting.
